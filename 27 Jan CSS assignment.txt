Q1. Why is it called a pseudo-class?

Ans. The term "pseudo" means false or fake, and "class" refers to a group of elements that share a common attribute. Pseudo-classes are called "pseudo" because they are not actual classes defined in the HTML code, but rather they are a way to target and style elements based on their dynamic state or action.

Pseudo-classes are written with a colon (:) followed by the name of the pseudo-class, such as :hover, :active, or :focus. These classes allow you to style elements based on user interaction or other dynamic events, without the need to add extra classes or attributes to the HTML code.

Overall, pseudo-classes are a powerful tool in CSS that allow for dynamic styling of web page elements without modifying the HTML structure.

Q2. What are gradients in CSS?

Ans. In CSS, gradients are a type of background effect that allows you to create a smooth transition between two or more colors, or between a color and a transparent value. Gradients are created using the "linear-gradient()" or "radial-gradient()" CSS functions, which specify the start and end points of the gradient, and the colors or color stops to be used in the transition.

There are two main types of gradients in CSS:

Linear Gradients: A linear gradient creates a color transition that goes in a straight line, from one point to another. The gradient can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal, and can contain multiple color stops.

Radial Gradients: A radial gradient creates a color transition that goes from the center of a circle outwards, or from one point to another. The gradient can be circular, elliptical, or in the shape of a line, and can contain multiple color stops.

Q3. What are different types of transitions in CSS?

Ans. In CSS, there are several types of transitions that can be applied to elements to create smooth animation effects when a property changes. Some of the most common types of transitions in CSS are:

Color transitions: These transitions allow you to smoothly change the color of an element, such as the background color or text color.

Opacity transitions: These transitions allow you to smoothly change the opacity or transparency of an element.

Size transitions: These transitions allow you to smoothly change the size of an element, such as the width, height, or font size.

Position transitions: These transitions allow you to smoothly change the position of an element, such as moving it from one location to another on the page.

Shape transitions: These transitions allow you to smoothly change the shape of an element, such as transforming a rectangle into a circle or triangle.

Transform transitions: These transitions allow you to smoothly change the transform property of an element, such as rotating, scaling, or skewing it.
