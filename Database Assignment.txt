Q1. What is a database? Explain with an example on why should we need a database.

A database is a structured collection of data organized for easy retrieval, management, and update. For example, a customer database for an e-commerce site stores information like names, addresses, and purchase history. We need databases for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management, enabling organized and quick access to information.

Q2. Write a short note on file-based storage systems. Explain the major challenges of a file-based storage system.

File-based storage systems store data in files, lacking the organizational structure of databases. Challenges include data redundancy, inconsistency, difficulty in retrieval, lack of data integrity, and limited security measures.

Q3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?

DBMS (Database Management System) is software that facilitates the creation, organization, and management of databases. The need for DBMS arises from the limitations of file-based systems, offering better data organization, retrieval, and security, and reducing data redundancy and inconsistency.

Q4. Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage systems that were tackled by DBMS.

1. Data Redundancy: DBMS eliminates duplicate data.
2. Data Inconsistency: Ensures data integrity through constraints.
3. Limited Retrieval: Offers efficient query and retrieval mechanisms.
4. Security Concerns: Implements user authentication and access controls.
5. Data Independence: Allows changes in data structure without affecting applications.

Q5. List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.

Types of Classification in DBMS:
1. Based on Data Model: Relational, Hierarchical, Network, Object-Oriented.
2. Based on Usage: Operational, Analytical, Data Warehousing.
3. Based on Number of Users: Single-user, Multi-user.
4. Based on Data Abstraction: Physical, Logical.

Explained:
- Relational Model: Organizes data in tables.
- Operational Database: Supports daily operations.
- Single-User Database: Accessed by a single user.
- Physical Abstraction: Deals with storage details.

Q6. What is the significance of data modeling and explain the types of data modeling.

Data modeling is crucial for designing databases. It visually represents data entities, relationships, and attributes. Types:
1. Conceptual Data Model: Abstract representation of data concepts.
2. Logical Data Model: Defines how data is stored and accessed.
3. Physical Data Model: Specifies data storage details.

Q7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.

The three-schema architecture comprises:
1. User Schema (View Level): Describes how data is presented to users.
2. Logical Schema (Conceptual Level): Represents the organization of data.
3. Physical Schema (Internal Level): Defines how data is stored.

Advantages:
- Data Independence: Changes in one schema don't affect others.
- Security Enhancement: Different access levels for each schema.
- Ease of Modification: Changes can be made at one schema level without affecting others.
